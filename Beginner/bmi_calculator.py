"""The Body Mass Index or BMI is calculated from weight and height of a Person. 
The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individualâ€™s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, 
then dividing the answer again by their height. We will complete this task by performing a couple of steps.

The steps we will perform are:
1. We will take user height in centimeters
2. Then we will take user weight in kilograms
3. We will then convert height to meters
4. Compute the bmi by dividing the weight by the sqaure of the height in meters
5. Print out corresponding strength of the results

This task will sharpen our skills on conditional statements and data types
